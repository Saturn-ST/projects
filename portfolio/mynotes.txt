How cool would it be to have a working prototype of the website I'm showing on my website. 
i.e. I'm scrolling through my profile and come across the grid of projects
I hover over one of the projects and my pointer changes
the it changes again when i hover over a link inside the projects
I can now click on that link and it behaves as the website
Basically the grid is a grid of browsers serving the websites on my portfolio (find out if this is possible or something close to it.)

Have the colors change to gradient on select
Change Name to underlined gradient instead of the Sa\turn being those colors
Change Sa\turn to ST
