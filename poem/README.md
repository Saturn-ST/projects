HTML, CSS, and JS site for poetry

Website concept: 
Answer the question or insert your idea in the box and see your poem update on the left. 
See others' work and save to favorites. 
Profile page shows your own poems.

Created starter html and css. Will continue to add as my skills improve. 

I've made some changes to the concept that include adding a blog, an edit poem section and more. 

- Redesigned the site using Figma.
- Changed navbar to a responsive bootstrap version.
- Added a footer with bootstrap navbar elements.
- Created a responsive hero section describing the site, includes a button.
- Implemented new color palette and fonts.
- Created responsive information cards to display featured content in the center of the page.
- Added social media icons.
