        <li>From a more hopeful time: colorful images with notes on techniques of persuasion and coalition building. (* means the section is not yet completed.)</li>
        <li>I collected them during my months at the Center for Rationality at the Hebrew University.  I didn&apos;t take any “working” posters down—in my home country of Canada that would be illegal.  Either I took it after the vote, or it had fallen down, or I found it lying on the street or in the bushes, and a stray that was never put up.   Sometimes a distributor would leave a stack of posters at a location for operatives to put up, but the rivals would find it and throw the pile into the bushes.</li>
        <li>In Israel taking posters down or covering them over was a strategy — squads of putter-uppers would plan to do their work at an early morning time in the morning, knowing that the poster&apos;s life was measured in hours.</li>
        <li>Some, like Netanyahu above, were creatively graffitied.  Others I had to assemble from fragments of several copies, that had been ripped and defaced by opponents.  In two cases I had to climb a steep slope to retrieve the prize.  Sometimes the posters were glued on top of one another, 15 or 20 deep; eventually the entire cake would unpeel and by soaking it in the bathtub I could separate the layers and get some special item.</li>
